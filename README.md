# Image-Steganography
The project employs a novel approach to steganography by using a shuffled image as the carrier for the ciphertext. The ciphertext and shuffled image are combined to create a stego shuffled image. The stego image is then shuffled again to create a final shuffled image. The decryption process is simply the reverse of the encryption process, with the final shuffled image being deshuffled to extract the stego image. The stego image is then used to extract the ciphertext, which can be decrypted using the 3DES algorithm to retrieve the original message.
The use of the 3DES encryption algorithm ensures that the ciphertext is secure and cannot be easily deciphered by unauthorised parties. The image shuffler, on the other hand, ensures that the stego image is indistinguishable from the original image, making it difficult for anyone to detect the presence of hidden information.
Overall, this steganography project offers a robust and effective solution for secure communication and data storage, making it a valuable tool for anyone who values data privacy and security.
